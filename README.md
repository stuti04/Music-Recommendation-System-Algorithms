# Review Paper: Comparison of Different Music Recommendation System Algorithms

### About The Repository

In this repository, I have added the codes for the algorithms that I along with my team used for comparison while working on a review paper. Our paper titled 'Comparison of Different Music Recommendation System Algorithms' was written in order to compare different machine learning and deep learning algorithms and find which has the highesy accuracy for providing appropriate music recommendations. The algorithms that were compared are - Singular Value Decomposition, Deep Neural Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Bayesian Personalized Ranking and Autoencoders.
